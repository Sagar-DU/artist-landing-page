                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>Well web development is something that can't be replace with something easy for my foreseeable future. Yeah ofcourse if you're just an ordinary developer how can just do one or two thing then you'll be replaced soon enough. But I want to be a hardcore developer which can't be replace by automation that easily.</p>
